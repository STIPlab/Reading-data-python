TH66,"Research and innovation for society|Science, technology and innovation culture","What are the main policy initiatives for building understandings and a culture of science, innovation, creativity, and critical thinking in 
society?","Awareness campaigns or education initiatives (e.g. science days, exhibitions, broadcasting programmes etc.); integrated communication operations (including more participatory strategies or face-to-face communications); the promotion of exemplary STI achievements (e.g. awards, prizes etc.); S&T museums, etc.
Education initiatives encompassing the introduction of participatory learning techniques (e.g. hands-on learning exercises or mentorship at school etc.); major revisions of educational curricula or reforms of instructional practices in primary and secondary schools; innovation prizes and contests that have a wide audience.
Initiatives to support or incentivize the development of social and grassroots innovations initiated by civil society or community-based organisations.",6.4
TH101,Net zero transitions|Net zero transitions policy debates,"Briefly, what are the current main policy debates around how net zero emission targets are being incorporated into STI policy objectives, design and implementation?","Your answer should provide a synthetic open text of 2 to 3 paragraphs describing the current main debates around the use of research and innovation to achieve net zero emission targets, including emerging visions and shifts in policy direction.
A policy debate may include various positions or options regarding policy action to orient research and innovation activities towards net zero. These may be expressed in different settings such as government bodies, legislatures, the media, among research and innovation actors, etc. They may or may not have been followed up by concrete actions. Of particular interest are the different positions of various stakeholders and the different options considered during debates. Initiatives resulting from these debates should be reported in the different questions on policy initiatives, as relevant. 
This statement will be used to create dashboards and notes in the STIP Compass portal.",M.1.1
TH102,Net zero transitions|Government capabilities for net zero transitions,"What reforms, if any, have been implemented to improve the operation and capabilities of STI ministries and agencies to better address net zero transitions?","Changes to governance structures, organisational capabilities, relationships with other areas of government, business and civil society, regulations, guidelines and other types of interventions to strengthen how the government designs and implements STI policies to support net zero transitions.
Countries should only report changes in government departments (e.g. ministries or equivalent) and agencies.",M.1.2
TH92,Net zero transitions|Net zero transitions in energy,"What policy initiatives aim primarily to incentivise or otherwise support research and/or technology innovation  to reduce emissions from energy supply or use, make clean energy more affordable, or mitigate fossil 
fuel emissions in other ways?","The policy scope is broad and covers R&D and demonstration funding, financial instruments targeting innovators, tax incentives, regulatory measures, support to tech entrepreneurs, knowledge sharing, networks, strategic research plans, prizes, performance targets etc. It includes all the ways in which governments accept or share technological risk, and lower the barriers facing pre-commercial technology developers. 
The technology scope covers any hardware or software improvements that raise the performance or lower the costs of supplying or using energy in ways that are compatible with a world in which greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced to �net zero�. Engineered carbon dioxide removal technologies and mitigation of fossil fuel related emissions in industrial sectors such as chemicals, cement and iron and steel are in scope. 
�Energy� includes fuels, heat and electricity used in buildings, industry, transport or other sectors. Specific attention may be given to policies, strategies and/or programmes focusing on hard-to-decarbonise sectors where key technologies are relatively less mature (e.g. heavy industry or long distance transport).",M.1.3
TH103,Net zero transitions|Net zero transitions in transport and mobility,"What policy initiatives, if any, aim specifically to support research and innovation for net-zero carbon ambitions in the transport and mobility sectors?","Transport and mobility research and innovation strategies and policies (e.g. major R&D and demonstration projects, support schemes, emerging technology regulation) aiming to contribute to achieving net-zero CO2 emissions (i.e. deep decarbonisation), in any supply-side or end-use sector (e.g. research and innovation for electric vehicles, public transport systems innovation, smart cities, shared modes of transport). Specific attention may be given to policies, strategies and/or programmes focusing on hard-to-decarbonise sectors where key technologies for decarbonisation are relatively less mature (e.g. long-distance transportation such as shipping and aviation), or on key emerging low-carbon energy technologies (e.g. low-carbon hydrogen, advanced biofuels).",M.1.4
TH104,Net zero transitions|Net zero transitions in food and agriculture,"What policy initiatives, if any, aim specifically to support research and innovation for net-zero carbon ambitions in the food and agriculture sectors?","Food and agriculture research and innovation strategies and policies (e.g. major R&D and demonstration projects, support schemes, emerging technology regulation) aiming to contribute to achieving net-zero CO2 emissions (i.e. deep decarbonisation), in any supply-side or end-use sector. Examples include carbon sequestration, remote sensing technologies to monitor land use, precision agriculture, non-CO2 emission abatement technologies, and food chain traceability and waste reduction technologies. Specific attention may be given to policies, strategies and/or programmes focusing on hard-to-decarbonise sectors where key technologies for decarbonisation are relatively less mature (e.g. gene editing and other plant breeding technologies).",M.1.5
TH112, Net zero transitions|Net zero transitions in steel,"What policy initiatives, if any, aim specifically to support research and innovation for net zero carbon ambitions in the steel sector?","Steel research and innovation strategies and policies (e.g. major R&D and demonstration projects, support schemes, emerging technology regulation) aiming to contribute to achieving net-zero CO2 emissions (i.e. deep decarbonisation), in any supply-side or end-use sector. Examples include policy support for hydrogen infrastructure and carbon storage, the development of sector-specific roadmaps, support for decarbonisation options related to steel production (e.g. hydrogen-based direct reduced iron/electric arc furnaces (DRI EAF) 
and carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS)), and demand-side policies such as green public 
procurement standards. 
Attention may also be given to policies, strategies and/or programmes focusing on technologies for decarbonisation that are relatively less mature (e.g. breakthrough low-carbon technologies and scrap-based EAF technology).
Note: While the STIP Compass survey already includes questions related to sectors such as energy and transport, including a question on steel decarbonisation acknowledges its role in industrial emissions and highlights the need for targeted strategies across all high-emission sectors. Currently, the steel industry is responsible for around 7% of CO2 emissions globally.",M.1.7
